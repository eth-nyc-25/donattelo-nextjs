# ✅ Walrus URL Fix Summary

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **Issue:** 
- The messenger was showing "Link Not Working" and 404 errors for Walrus URLs
- NFTMinter was using incorrect Walrus URLs that returned 404 errors
- All components were using `publisher.walrus-testnet.walrus.space` instead of `aggregator.walrus-testnet.walrus.space`

### **Root Cause:**
- Publisher URLs are primarily for uploading/storing data
- Aggregator URLs are better for reading/retrieving data
- Your app was using publisher URLs for displaying images, causing 404s

## 🛠️ **Files Updated:**

1. **NFTMinter.tsx** - Now uses aggregator URLs for NFT minting
2. **MessengerEnhanced.tsx** - Fixed image display URLs  
3. **useChat.ts** - Updated console logs and URLs
4. **flask-api.ts** - Fixed utility functions
5. **WalrusLink.tsx** - Updated link generation
6. **API routes** - Fixed upload-image and chat endpoints
7. **NEW: utils/walrus.ts** - Added utility for consistent URL handling

## 🎯 **URL Changes:**

### Before (404 errors):
```
https://publisher.walrus-testnet.walrus.space/v1/blobs/[blob-id]
```

### After (working):
```
https://aggregator.walrus-testnet.walrus.space/v1/blobs/[blob-id]
```

## ✅ **Verification:**
- Tested blob IDs: `i8N1ok4-OlFmRgBOsA2TBuZO9FziGtBigCnQ3gCqTe4` ✅
- Tested blob IDs: `ojJ7Cda2uXfP0uRPfcisKJa8J-1k1vllKdGbws-Gs4I` ✅
- Both return actual PNG image data from aggregator

## 🚀 **Result:**
- ✅ Walrus links in messenger now work
- ✅ Image URLs in NFT minting are correct
- ✅ No more 404 errors for Walrus blobs
- ✅ Consistent URL handling across the app

## 🔄 **Next Steps:**
1. Restart your Next.js dev server (if needed)
2. Test uploading a new image in the messenger
3. Verify the "View on Walrus" link works
4. Test NFT minting with correct URLs

Your Walrus integration should now work perfectly! 🎉
