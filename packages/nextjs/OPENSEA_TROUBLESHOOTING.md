# OpenSea API Troubleshooting Guide

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. API Key Not Working (404, 401, 403 Errors)

#### Problem: Getting 404, 401, or 403 errors when testing OpenSea API

#### Solutions:

**Step 1: Verify API Key Format**
- OpenSea API keys typically start with `2` and are around 64 characters long
- Make sure you copied the entire key without extra spaces
- Check that the key is in your `.env.local` file

**Step 2: Check Environment Variable**
```bash
# In packages/nextjs/.env.local
OPENSEA_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Step 3: Verify API Key Permissions**
- Log into your OpenSea account
- Go to API settings
- Ensure your key has the necessary permissions:
  - Read access to collections
  - Read access to NFTs
  - Write access (if you plan to create listings)

**Step 4: Test with Different Endpoints**
The integration now uses `/collections` endpoint which is more reliable than `/chain/*` endpoints.

### 2. Environment Variable Not Loading

#### Problem: API key shows as "Not Set" in debug info

#### Solutions:

**Check File Location**
- Ensure `.env.local` is in `packages/nextjs/` directory
- Not in the root project directory

**Restart Development Server**
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
yarn start
```

**Check File Format**
```bash
# .env.local should look like this (no spaces around =)
OPENSEA_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENSEA_API_BASE=https://api.opensea.io/api/v2
```

### 3. Network/Connection Issues

#### Problem: Network errors or timeouts

#### Solutions:

**Check Internet Connection**
- Ensure you can access other websites
- Try accessing https://api.opensea.io in your browser

**Check Firewall/Proxy**
- Some corporate networks block API calls
- Try from a different network if possible

**Rate Limiting**
- OpenSea has rate limits
- Wait a few minutes between requests
- Check if you've exceeded your plan's limits

### 4. API Key Expired or Invalid

#### Problem: Getting 401 Unauthorized errors

#### Solutions:

**Get a New API Key**
1. Visit [OpenSea API Documentation](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-overview)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Generate a new API key
4. Replace the old key in your `.env.local` file

**Check Account Status**
- Ensure your OpenSea account is active
- Check if there are any account restrictions

## ðŸ”§ Debugging Steps

### 1. Use the API Key Validation Tool
- Go to `/test` page
- Click "ðŸ”‘ Validate API Key" button
- Review the detailed validation results

### 2. Check Console Logs
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check the Console tab for error messages
- Check the Network tab for API call details

### 3. Test API Key Manually
```bash
# Test with curl (replace YOUR_API_KEY)
curl -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     "https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/collections"
```

## ðŸ“‹ Environment Variable Checklist

```bash
# Required
OPENSEA_API_KEY=your_64_character_api_key_here

# Optional (will use defaults if not set)
OPENSEA_API_BASE=https://api.opensea.io/api/v2
OPENSEA_SANDBOX_BASE=https://testnets-api.opensea.io/api/v2
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_TESTNET=false
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Setup

### 1. Basic Test
```bash
# Start your development server
cd donattelo-nextjs/packages/nextjs
yarn start
```

### 2. Navigate to Test Page
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/test`
- Click "ðŸ”‘ Validate API Key"
- Review the results

### 3. Expected Results
If everything is working:
- âœ… API key shows as "Configured"
- âœ… Validation shows "API key appears to be working correctly!"
- âœ… Connection test returns successful response
